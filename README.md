# Among FOSS

A recreation of Among Us mechanics but as a multiplayer text adventure game instead of a graphical client.

## Building

```shell-session
$ meson build
$ ninja -C build
```

That's it.

## Running

```shell-session
$ ./build/src/among-foss
```

This starts the server on port 1234. Then players can connect to it using any client made for this game.

## Clients

There are no clients for this game yet. Be the first to make one and open an issue!
